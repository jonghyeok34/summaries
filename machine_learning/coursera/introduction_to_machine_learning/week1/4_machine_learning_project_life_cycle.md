- machine learning project lifecycle
  - scoping -> data -> modeling -> deployment
  - cycle is iterative process
- edge deployment vs cloud deployment
  - edge deployment
    - less computational power available
    - less network bandhwidth needed
    - lower latency
    - can function even if network connection is down

- labeling inconsistently is problemetic
  - "Um, today's weather", "Um..., today's weather" is okay but, inconsistency will reduce performance.

- after deployment, monitor & maintain system help us handle casese of concept drift or data drift.
